# 1. Which of the following is an object and which is a basic type?
```java
int a;
double b;
int c[] = {1, 2, 3};
String s = "Hello World";
```
Objects:
- int c[]
- String s

Basic Type:
- int a;
- double n;

# 2. Static Methods
**(A) What is a static method in Java?** from internet?
A static method is a method that belongs to a class, not an object, and can be called without creating an instance of the class.
**(B) Why does the main method need to be a static method?**
The compiler can call the method directly without creating an instance of the class.

# 3. What is the output of the following programs?
```java
/* Program 1 */
public static void main(final String args[]) {
    String choice = new String("A");
    if (choice == "A") {
        System.out.println("Correct");
    }
    else {
        System.out.println("Wrong");
    }
}
```
```
Output: "Wrong"
```

```java
/* Program 2 */
public static void main(final String args[]) {
    String choice = new String("A");
    if (choice.equals("A")) {
        System.out.println("Correct");
    }
    else {
        System.out.println("Wrong");
    }
}
```
```
Output: "Correct"
```

# 4. Does the below program change the season? Why, or why not?
```java
static void change_season(String str) {
    str = "Spring";
}

public static void main(final String args[]) {
    String season = "Winter";
    change_season(season);
    System.out.println("The current season is: " + season);
}
```
No, the program does not change the season, since 

# 5. What is the output of the main method below? Please explain.
```java
public class Point {
    double x = 0;
    double y = 0;

    public Point(double x, double y) {
        x = x;
        y = y;
    }
}
public static void main(final String args[]) {
    Point point = new Point(1, 2);
    System.out.println("X: " + point.x + " Y: " + point.y);
}
```
```
Output:
```
explanation:

# 6. What principle of OOP does the private declaration for variable and functions achieve? Explain.


# 7. In the Point class below, how does Java choose between the two constructors.
```java
public class Point {

   private double x, y; 
   
   public Point(double x, double y) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
   }

   public Point(Point other) {
       this.x = other.getX();
       this.y = other.getY();
   }
}
```


# 8. Consider below:
```java
public class Point {
   private double x,y; //the x,y fields
   public Point(double x,double y); //construct a point from an x,y
   public Point(Point other); //construct a point from another point
   public double getX(); //return the x component
   public double getY(); //return the y component
   public double setXY(double x, double y); //sets the x and y fields
   public String toString(); //return the string representation
   private double sum_x_y(); // Returns the sum of X and Y
}
```
**Say we want to make a class that extends Point with a method that can reflect a point across the X and Y axis. Which of the following implementations achieves this?**
public class CustomPoint extends Point {
    public void reflect(); // Reflects point
}
```
Option __
```java

```

# 9. If we add this constructor to CustomPoint, and then run the below program, what is the output?:
```java
public CustomPoint() {
    setXY(10, 10); // Line 1
    super(0, 0); // Line 2
}
public static void main(final String args[]) {
    CustomPoint p = new CustomPoint();
    System.out.println(p.toString());
}
```
```
Output:
```

# 10. What if we switch line 1 and 2 in the previous question?


# 11. If we want to override sum_x_y in our custom point, but first reflect the point before returning the sum, which of the following implementations are valid? (Note: assume that reflect has a valid implementation)
Option __:
```java

```

# 12. What is the point of the protected modifier? Why do we have it and how does it work in terms of inheritance?


# 13. Consider the following class: 
```java
public class Racecar {

    private int number; 
    private Driver driver; //assume implemented properly
    protected String sponsor = null;
    public Racecar(int n, Driver d) {
        number = n;
        driver = d;
    }

    public String toString() {
        return "Car #" + number + " Driver: " + driver;
    }
    
    protected addSponsor(String sp) {
        sponsor = sp;
    }
}
```
**Suppose we want to extend this to a FormulaOne class which has a make, e.g., Mercedes. Complete the constructor and toString() method.**
```java
public class FormulaOne extends Racecar {
    private String make;

    //TODO

}
```

# 14. Using the Racecar and FormulaOne classes above, if we had a main method in a different class than either of those,
```java
public static void main(String args[]) {

   Racecar r = new Racecar(/* ... some args .. */);
   r.addSponsor("Home Depot"); //<--A

   FormulaOne f1 = new FormulaOne(/* ... some args .. */);
   f1.addSponsor("Home Depot"); //<--B
     
}
```
**Does the code work at mark A or mark B or neither? Explain.**


# 15. Consider the UML diagram from the notes. Expand this to include an intern. An intern is like an employee, has a manager, unit, but has an expiration on their employment. How does this fit into the UML diagram?
