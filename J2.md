# 1. Which of the following is an object and which is a basic type?
```java
int a;
double b;
int c[] = {1, 2, 3};
String s = "Hello World";
```
Objects:
- int c[]
- String s

Basic Type:
- int a
- double n

# 2. Static Methods
**(A) What is a static method in Java?**

A static method is a method that belongs to a class, not an object, and can be called without creating an instance of the class.

**(B) Why does the main method need to be a static method?**

The compiler can call the method directly without creating an instance of the class.

# 3. What is the output of the following programs?
```java
/* Program 1 */
public static void main(final String args[]) {
    String choice = new String("A");
    if (choice == "A") {
        System.out.println("Correct");
    }
    else {
        System.out.println("Wrong");
    }
}
```
```
Output: "Wrong"
```

```java
/* Program 2 */
public static void main(final String args[]) {
    String choice = new String("A");
    if (choice.equals("A")) {
        System.out.println("Correct");
    }
    else {
        System.out.println("Wrong");
    }
}
```
```
Output: "Correct"
```

# 4. Does the below program change the season? Why, or why not?
```java
static void change_season(String str) {
    str = "Spring";
}

public static void main(final String args[]) {
    String season = "Winter";
    change_season(season);
    System.out.println("The current season is: " + season);
}
```
No, the program does not change the season in the main method, because when the variable season is passed to change_season, a copy of the reference to the season String is made within the method. Since no value is returned from the change_season method and reassigned, the original reference remains unchanged.

# 5. What is the output of the main method below? Please explain.
```java
public class Point {
    double x = 0;
    double y = 0;

    public Point(double x, double y) {
        x = x;
        y = y;
    }
}
public static void main(final String args[]) {
    Point point = new Point(1, 2);
    System.out.println("X: " + point.x + " Y: " + point.y);
}
```
```
Output: X: 0.0 Y: 0.0
```
Explanation: The parameters x and y are local variables that shadow the instance variables x and y of the Point class. So, when it runs x = x or y = y, it is just reassigning the local variable x to itself, instead of changing this.x or this.y.

# 6. What principle of OOP does the private declaration for variable and functions achieve? Explain.
Private declaration for variable and functions achieves encapsulation, so that the programmer only needs to know the public interface class in order to use it, while everything else is hidden via private fields and methods. Making variable private protects them from being accessed or modified from outside code, and encapsulation allows the programmer to create getter and setter methods to have limited access to the private variables.

# 7. In the Point class below, how does Java choose between the two constructors.
```java
public class Point {

   private double x, y; 
   
   public Point(double x, double y) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
   }

   public Point(Point other) {
       this.x = other.getX();
       this.y = other.getY();
   }
}
```
Java will choose between two constructors based on the type and number of arguments passed as parameters when a Point object is created. If two doubles are passed, the first one will be used, and, when another Point object is passed, the second will be used.

# 8. Consider below:
```java
public class Point {
   private double x,y; //the x,y fields
   public Point(double x,double y); //construct a point from an x,y
   public Point(Point other); //construct a point from another point
   public double getX(); //return the x component
   public double getY(); //return the y component
   public double setXY(double x, double y); //sets the x and y fields
   public String toString(); //return the string representation
   private double sum_x_y(); // Returns the sum of X and Y
}
```
**Say we want to make a class that extends Point with a method that can reflect a point across the X and Y axis. Which of the following implementations achieves this?**
```java
public class CustomPoint extends Point {
    public void reflect(); // Reflects point
}
```
Option 4
```java
public void reflect() {
    double x = -this.getX();
    double y =-this.getY();
    this.setXY(x,y);
}
```
Option 4 is the correct implementation since it uses the encapsulation by using getter and setter methods on the private variables.

# 9. If we add this constructor to CustomPoint, and then run the below program, what is the output?:
```java
public CustomPoint() {
    setXY(10, 10); // Line 1
    super(0, 0); // Line 2
}
public static void main(final String args[]) {
    CustomPoint p = new CustomPoint();
    System.out.println(p.toString());
}
```
```
Output: Error
```
There will be an error since super() which tries to use the parent class's constructor, so it needs to be the first statement in the code.

# 10. What if we switch line 1 and 2 in the previous question?
This would resolve the error, because the super() call must be the first statement in the constructor in order to invoke the parent class constructor.

# 11. If we want to override sum_x_y in our custom point, but first reflect the point before returning the sum, which of the following implementations are valid? (Note: assume that reflect has a valid implementation)
```java
//Option 1
public double sum_x_y() {
    this.reflect();
    return super.sum_x_y();
}

//Option 2
public double sum_x_y() {
    this.reflect();
    return this.getX() + this.getY();
}
```
Options 1 and 2 are both valid implementations. Option 1, first, calls this.reflect to reflect the point, then uses super.sum_x_y() to call the parent's class method and return the sum of the reflected values. Option 2 reflects the points, then directly sums with the getter methods, but without calling the parent class. The other options are creating a new method, instead of overriding sum_x_y.

# 12. What is the point of the protected modifier? Why do we have it and how does it work in terms of inheritance?
The protected modifer allows a class to access fields, methods, or constructors from other subclasses or classes within the same package, but restricting acces to outside classes that are not related through inheritance. When a method is defined with protected keyword, subclasses and classes in the same package can access. This relates to inheritance because subclasses can inherit and accesss these members of the parent class, while restricting them from unrelated classes.

# 13. Consider the following class: 
```java
public class Racecar {

    private int number; 
    private Driver driver; //assume implemented properly
    protected String sponsor = null;
    public Racecar(int n, Driver d) {
        number = n;
        driver = d;
    }

    public String toString() {
        return "Car #" + number + " Driver: " + driver;
    }
    
    protected addSponsor(String sp) {
        sponsor = sp;
    }
}
```
**Suppose we want to extend this to a FormulaOne class which has a make, e.g., Mercedes. Complete the constructor and toString() method.**
```java
public class FormulaOne extends Racecar {
    private String make;

    //TODO
    public FormulaOne(int n, Driver d, String make) {
        super(n,d);
        this.make = make;
    }

    public String toString() {
        return "Make: " + make + ", " + super.toString();
    }
}
```

# 14. Using the Racecar and FormulaOne classes above, if we had a main method in a different class than either of those,
```java
public static void main(String args[]) {

   Racecar r = new Racecar(/* ... some args .. */);
   r.addSponsor("Home Depot"); //<--A

   FormulaOne f1 = new FormulaOne(/* ... some args .. */);
   f1.addSponsor("Home Depot"); //<--B
     
}
```
**Does the code work at mark A or mark B or neither? Explain.**

The code won't work at either marks because the addSponsor method is protected, and the main method is outside the inheritance key. The main method is located in a different class from the Racecar and FormulaOne classes and not allowed access to protected methods directly.

# 15. Consider the UML diagram from the notes. Expand this to include an intern. An intern is like an employee, has a manager, unit, but has an expiration on their employment. How does this fit into the UML diagram?
Intern would be a subclass of Employee with an additional attribute of expiration as an integer. Since Employee has association with Unit and Manager, Intern would also belong to a Unit and report to a Manager.
